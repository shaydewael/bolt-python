<div class="section-content">
All listeners have access to a `context` dictionary, which can be used to enrich events with additional information. Bolt automatically attaches information if itâ€™s included in the incoming event, like `user_id`, `team_id`, `channel_id`, and `enterprise_id`.

`context` is just a dictionary, so you can directly modify it.

```python
# Listener middleware to fetch tasks from external system using userId
def fetchTasks(context, event, next):
    user = event["user"]

    try:
        # Assume getTasks fetchs tasks from DB corresponding to user ID
        user_tasks = db.getTasks(user)
        tasks = user_tasks
    except Exception as e:
        # getTasks() raises exception because no tasks are found
        tasks = []
    finally:
        # Put user's tasks in context
        context["tasks"] = tasks
    next()

# Listener middleware to create a list of section blocks
def createSections(context, next)
    taskBlocks = []

    # Loops through tasks added to context in previous middleware
    for task in context["tasks"]:
        taskBlocks.append(
            {
              "type": "section",
              "text": {
                  "type": "mrkdwn",
